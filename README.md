# Galaga Clone

This simple clone of the classic Galaga arcade game uses sprite assets found in
`space_starter_kit`. Additional spaceship graphics from `SpaceShipsPack-AntuZ`
are loaded for the enemy fleet, providing more variety. This version tracks your
remaining lives, shown as small ships at the bottom of the screen. You start
with three ships in total. Run it with:
```bash
python3 galaga.py
```
