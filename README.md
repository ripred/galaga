# galaga

This is a very small Galaga-like game implemented with Pygame. It features a
player-controlled ship that can move left or right and shoot bullets at a row of
enemies. The game now tracks multiple lives. Remaining ships are displayed in
the lower-left corner so you can easily see how many lives you have left.

Run the game with:

```bash
python galaga.py
```
