# Galaga Clone

This simple clone of the classic Galaga arcade game uses sprite assets found in
`space_starter_kit`. Additional spaceship graphics from `SpaceShipsPack-AntuZ`
are loaded for the enemy fleet, providing more variety. This version tracks your
remaining lives, shown as small ships at the bottom of the screen and now keeps
score for each enemy you destroy. Waves of enemies become progressively harder
and the current wave number is displayed in the top right corner. You start with
three ships in total. Run it with:
```bash
python3 galaga.py
```
The current score is shown in the top left corner of the game window.
